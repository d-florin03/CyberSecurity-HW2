# CyberSecurity-HW2

The homework contains 4 tasks and a special `remote-shell` one (no flags in
there, but serves as frontend to all others, read on):

  - `message-send`: networking (easy);
  - `ghost-in-the-shell`: networking (moderate);
  - `jwt-auth`: web challenge (moderate);
  - `sqli-cart`: web challenge (moderate/hard);

Each task challenges you to find a "flag", a string with the form
`SpeishFlag{<random hash>}` (internal joke).
There is a single flag per task: if you got one with the appropriate syntax, it 
will be accepted as the correct solution (please take care when decoding or 
manually copying it, e.g. zero vs 'o').
